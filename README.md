# text_graph
Graph a function with text in Python 2

This code works by taking the user's function as a string, and writing it into a separate python file, with an "f(x)" function. I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but when I worked on this in high school, I felt very clever, so I'm leaving it as it is.

Try running:
python graph_2.py < sample_input.txt
